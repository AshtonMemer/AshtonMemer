## 👋 Hello, I am Ashton
I'm a seasoned programmer with a sophisticated taste for rhythm games.
### ⌨️ Programming Stuff
I dabble in the arts of frontend, backend, and database development. My favorite language is C# but I am also proficient in JavaScript, which i primarily use for backend. I take on miscellaneous projects but I definitely do a lot of rhythm game modding. 
### 🚀 My projects 
- **MDMC**: The Muse Dash Modding Community [[GitHub](https://github.com/MDMods)]
  - I am the owner and one of the primary developers of MDMC, a group dedicated to modding and adding custom songs & community content to the hit rhythm game Muse Dash.
- **ReSYNX**: The MUSYNX Restoration Project [[GitHub](https://github.com/ReSYNX)]
  - ReSYNX is a (currently private) project that aims to help the best parts of MUSYNX stand out while providing quality-of-life improvements and brand new features in the process.

Feel free to check them out if you have the time.
